# Introducing the serviettUI

### About the serviettUI

> [!CAUTION]
> The project is currently unstable!

**serviettUI** - is a new declarative UI framework. Create fast UI easily.

### UI

The design was inspired by SwiftUI and Human Interface Guidelines.

The design uses a modern font `Inter`, which looks great in such designs.

We also use animations obtained from mathematical functions based on the laws of physics, so that the design is as natural and pleasing to the eye as possible.

### Compatibility

The design looks good on both mobile and desktop devices. The framework supports HiDPI matrices such as Apple's Retina by scaling the UI by 2 times and then reducing it to the size of the window.
